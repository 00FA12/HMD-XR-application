# Our Take on AR, VR, MR, AV, and XR  

After today’s lecture we were all like: “Wait, what’s the difference between all these R’s again?”  
So we sat down together and tried to make sense of it. Here’s what we came up with:  

---

## AR – Augmented Reality  
“Oh yeah, that’s like Pokémon GO!”  
“Or Snapchat filters where you get dog ears.”  
So basically, you still see the real world, but with some digital stuff on top of it.  

**In short:** real world + some extra layers.  

---

## VR – Virtual Reality  
“That one’s easy—you put on a headset and you’re not here anymore.”  
“It’s like being teleported into a video game or another planet.”  
The real world disappears, and everything is computer-made.  

**In short:** fully virtual, goodbye reality.  

---

## MR – Mixed Reality  
“At first we thought it was just AR with a fancier name, but nope.”  
“It’s cooler because the digital objects actually *interact* with the real world. Like a hologram pet hiding behind your real couch.”  
So it’s a mix that actually blends the two.  

**In short:** real + digital working together.  

---

## AV – Augmented Virtuality  
“None of us had really heard of this one before…”  
“It’s like the reverse of AR. Instead of putting digital stuff into the real world, you put real stuff into a virtual world.”  
Like when you see your own hands inside a VR game thanks to cameras. Could be used for concert. 

# How Do XR Apps Compare to Traditional Desktop and Mobile Apps?  

After we finally wrapped our heads around AR/VR/MR/AV/XR, the next question came up:  
“How are XR apps actually different from the apps we already use on our phones and laptops?”  

We talked it through, and here’s our group’s take:

## Advantages of XR Apps  

- **Immersion:**  
  “Instead of clicking buttons on a screen, you’re literally *inside* the experience.”  
  Great for training (like pilots, doctors), gaming, or even virtual tourism.  

- **Better Interaction:**  
  “Moving your hands, looking around, or walking feels way more natural than tapping on a phone.”  
  It’s more intuitive and can sometimes make learning easier.  

- **Real-world Context:**  
  “AR can put information right where you need it—like showing repair instructions directly on the machine you’re fixing.”  

- **Collaboration:**  
  “Virtual meeting rooms can feel more ‘together’ than a boring Zoom call.”  
  People can gather around the same 3D object, even if they’re in different countries.

## Disadvantages of XR Apps  

- **Hardware Needs:**  
  “Not everyone owns a VR headset or AR glasses. But everyone has a phone.”  
  The entry barrier is still pretty high.  

- **Accessibility & Comfort:**  
  “Some people get motion sickness or eye strain.”  
  XR still isn’t as universally comfortable as looking at a regular screen.  

- **Cost:**  
  “Building XR apps is usually more expensive than making a simple mobile app.”  
  Hardware, software, and design all cost more.  

- **Practicality:**  
  “Do you really need VR to check your email?”  
  For many daily tasks, normal apps are just faster and more efficient.

## Our Overall Thoughts  

We agreed that XR apps are **amazing for immersive experiences, training, design, and entertainment**, but they won’t fully replace desktop and mobile apps anytime soon.  

- For **quick, everyday tasks** → mobile and desktop still win.  
- For **experiences where immersion and interaction matter** → XR has the clear advantage.
