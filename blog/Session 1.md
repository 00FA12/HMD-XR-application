# Our Take on AR, VR, MR, AV, and XR  

After today’s lecture we were all like: “Wait, what’s the difference between all these R’s again?”  
So we sat down together and tried to make sense of it. Here’s what we came up with:  

---

## AR – Augmented Reality  
“Oh yeah, that’s like Pokémon GO!”  
“Or Snapchat filters where you get dog ears.”  
So basically, you still see the real world, but with some digital stuff on top of it.  

**In short:** real world + some extra layers.  

---

## VR – Virtual Reality  
“That one’s easy—you put on a headset and you’re not here anymore.”  
“It’s like being teleported into a video game or another planet.”  
The real world disappears, and everything is computer-made.  

**In short:** fully virtual, goodbye reality.  

---

## MR – Mixed Reality  
“At first we thought it was just AR with a fancier name, but nope.”  
“It’s cooler because the digital objects actually *interact* with the real world. Like a hologram pet hiding behind your real couch.”  
So it’s a mix that actually blends the two.  

**In short:** real + digital working together.

## AV – Augmented Virtuality  
“None of us had really heard of this one before…”  
“It’s like the reverse of AR. Instead of putting digital stuff into the real world, you put real stuff into a virtual world.”  
Like when you see your own hands inside a VR game thanks to cameras. Could be used for concert.
